## Goals

- Finish all deliverables on time  
- Meet the expectations of all deliverables  
- Divide the work appropriately
- Communicate in a timely manner

## Ground Rules
These define what group members expect from one another and what norms they agree on relating to behaviors and actions.

### Communication
- Use Discord as the primary means of communication  
- Respond to messages promptly
- Be respectful to one another  

### Meetings
- Use GitHub and/or Google Drive to collaborate on projects  
- Assign tasks to each member during meetings  
- Use meetings to check progress  
- Meet at least 2-3 times per deliverable  
- Show up to meetings on time and prepared  

### Deadlines
- All members must complete tasks before the deadline so there’s time to put it together  
- If unable to complete a task in time, communicate this ahead of time  

## Care Statement
Outline here how the team will strive to care for the health of each other and the team as a whole during the project duration:

- Check in regularly and assist one another with any difficulties  
- Refrain from dictating/dominating the discussion  
- Treat every member as an equal and value everyone’s input  

## Group Roles

| Aziz Durdyklychev | Equal Partner    | Collaborate with other members to set goals and finish deliverables in time |
| Dov Feuer         | Equal Partner          | Collaborate with other members to set goals and finish deliverables in time |

## Deliverables & Deadlines

|-------------------------|----------|--------|
| Proposal               | Jan 31   | All    |
| Early prototype        | Feb 12   | All    |
| Functional prototype   | Mar 16   | All    |
| Final report/presentation | Mar 31   | All    |

## Performance Agreement
Considers how the group will address non-performance of what is agreed upon. Whatever the group agrees upon should correspond to the impact or gravity of the issues at hand.

- Notify the group in advance if a deliverable is not finished in time or does not meet standards  
- Inform the professor which member failed to meet the agreed-upon performance  

## Signatures to the Agreement
If team members cannot add signatures in person, a group can agree that each member typing their name in the signature section suffices as agreement.
