§A. Interim Report Overview
The Interim Report serves as a partial milestone toward the Final Report (DEL 4.B), ensuring that teams have completed about two-thirds of the required work. This deliverable should:

Demonstrate substantial progress in developing the phenomenon overview, simulation design, and preliminary observations.

Establish a clear structure for the final report, making later refinements easier.

Provide early insights into model behavior and emergent dynamics based on initial simulation runs.

Identify key challenges, model limitations, and next steps. The Final Report (DEL 4.B) will expand on this work by incorporating finalized results, deeper analysis, and critical reflections.

§B. Interim Report Requirements
Your report should be approximately 2000 words and structured as follows. (The per-section word counts are suggestions.)

Create a subdirectory DEL3B_DraftReport under the Deliverable3 directory in your repo. You may continue using markdown as the document format or switch to another document format. Ensure the document file that contains the submission is pushed to the subdirectory prior to the submission deadline.

§1. Phenomenon Overview (~500 words)
Describe your chosen phenomenon and its significance in the context of AI-to-AI interactions in media ecosystems. Connect to the scholarly literature you cited in DEL 2 using in-line citations to support key assertions.

Provide a problem statement outlining why this issue is important.

Explain why agent-based modeling (ABM) is a suitable approach for studying this phenomenon.

Illustrate the Phenomenon:

Provide a preliminary sequence of visualizations from your simulation.

These visualizations should depict interactions between agents.

Include annotations explaining how the simulated behavior aligns with real-world dynamics.

For the final report, you will improve the visual illustration, integrate additional scholarly sources, and refine explanations based on feedback.

§2. Simulation Design & Implementation (~500 words)
System Overview: Describe the core components of your model, including the agents (human and bot).

Simulation Environment: Define the media ecosystem where agents interact (e.g., network-based, grid-based, hybrid).

Agent Design: Describe the types of agents in the simulation and their key behaviors. Explain decision-making processes and rule-based interactions Discuss any early adjustments made during development.

Interaction Dynamics: Describe the scheduler used (e.g., RandomActivation, StagedActivation), and explain how bot-to-bot interactions occur in the simulation. Explain how the phenomena of interest emerges in the simulation

Data Collection & Visualization: Describe what data is being collected and why. Include early visualizations or logs that show how data trends are forming. For the final report, you will expand on the technical details, improve the scheduler justification, and prepare more detailed descriptions of the data collection and visualization methods.

§3. Preliminary Observations & Results (~500 words)
Provide a description of how early simulation results illustrate the phenomenon of interest. Provide initial quantitative metrics or qualitative descriptions of emergent behaviors. Include graphs, tables, or network diagrams showcasing agent interactions.

Describe unexpected behaviors and/or emergent dynamics. Identify and discuss any unexpected trends observed in early runs. Identify potential causes of these behaviors based on agent parameters. For the final report, you will expand and the findings, refine interpretations, and conduct additional simulations for completeness and robustness of results

§4. Challenges & Next Steps (~500 words)
Development Challenges:

Describe the most difficult aspects of implementing the simulation.

Discuss any changes made to the model due to unforeseen challenges.

Planned Refinements for the Final Report:

Outline what needs to be further developed, tested, or refined before submission of DEL 4.B.

Identify additional data collection or analysis methods that will enhance findings.

§6. References
include full references to a minimum of 3 works cited in the report. Use APA format.

§7. Attestation
this section should attest that all group members contributed to the draft report.

provide a full and non-vague description of each member's contributions, both for the draft report and planned contributions for the final reported.

Use the Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT) to help articulate the contributions made by the group members in the production of this final report https://credit.niso.org/ For the final report, you will expand on ethics, societal implications, and long-term impacts in DEL 4.B.

§C. Deliverables & Submission Format
The submission consists of 1 file submission, to be submitted to DEL 3.B Draft Report. Ensure the submitted file is named correctly.

Submit, as a file, the Final Report: TeamX_DraftReport.pdf

§D Expectations
Meeting expectations generally results in a grade at the B+ level, potentially at the B or A level, depending on the specifics of the submission. Submission that reach an A+ level are those that go above and beyond expectations. Review the specification of DEL 4.B for further detail about "going above and beyond" expectations.
